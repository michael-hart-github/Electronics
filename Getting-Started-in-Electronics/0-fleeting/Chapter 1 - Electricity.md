You can build static electricity by walking across a carpeted floor with "hard soled shoes", while touching a lead from a neon lamp, and pressing the other lead to a metal object. Assuming the relative humidity isn't high, you will see the lamp flash.

All matter has electrical properties.

By the end of this book, I will be able to identify and use:
* Transformers
* Diodes
* Resistors
* Capacitors
* Zener diodes
* Transistors
* Voltage regulators
* and Integrated circuits
## Measuring AC and DC
A good quality multimeter is one that has high-impedance, which will mean it has little (or no) effect on the device or circuit being measured.
## Electrical circuits
An arrangement that allows electrical current to flow. A circuit can be anything from a battery-powered lamp, to a computer.
### Basic circuit
Consists of:
1. Electrical source (battery)
2. Lamp
3. and two connection wires

> [!NOTE]
> The part of a circuit which performs work is called the "load".

For this example, the lamp is the load. For other circuits, a motor, heating element, or electromagnet may be the load.
### Series circuit
Includes more than one component (e.g. more than one lamp). The series circuit is formed when current flows through one component first, then a second, then a third, etc. 
### Parallel circuit
A parallel circuit is formed when two (or more) components are connected in a way that current can flow between one component without needing to flow through a different component first.

E.g. if three lamps have each of their leads connected in a manner that did not make them reliant on electricity flowing through a different lamp before electricity reached each other lamp.
### Series-parallel circuit
This is a very common type of electrical circuit. This type of circuit is both series and parallel; they have both independent areas of the circuit where they do not rely on power going through one area first (parallel), as well as other areas which do require them to receive power in a certain order (series)
